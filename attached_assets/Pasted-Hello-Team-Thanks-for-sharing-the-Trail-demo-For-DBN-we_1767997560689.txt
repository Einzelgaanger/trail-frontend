Hello Team,

Thanks for sharing the Trail demo. For DBN, we need the prototype to resemble an “ESG Integrated Solution Dashboard” - meaning it must display end-to-end ESG operationalisation, not just SDG/Programme monitoring.  

1) What does the “ESG Integrated Solution” mean (DBN view)
The prototype must show that the system can support the full ESG cycle:

Collect ESG data (PFI submissions - Excel import is OK)

Validate & govern the data (quality checks, error log, approval workflow, audit trail)

Classify projects using DBN Green Taxonomy (Green / Transition / Not Green + evidence)

Track carbon & Net Zero (Scope 1/2/3 totals, basic calculation logic, targets & progress)

Generate ESG reports (exportable packs for DBN management + PFI compliance summary)

If these 5 are visible, DBN will see a “true integrated solution.”

2) What to keep from Trail
Keep your existing structure (menus, tables, reporting pages, forms management, import data, filters, export buttons). We want you to repurpose the content, not rebuild the app.

3) What to change/replace (high-level)
Your current views look like:

Program/beneficiary tracking

General “reports” (program/event/form reports)

Goals/KPIs for programmes

Some “business performance” style charts

For the DBN PoC, please replace these content types with ESG + PFI reporting + taxonomy + carbon.

Specifically:

Replace “beneficiaries/events/speakers/attendees” with projects, PFIs, ESG submissions, compliance status, taxonomy status, and carbon figures.

Replace “revenue/cash trend” type analytics with ESG data completeness, reporting timeliness, green portfolio %, and emissions trend.

4) What the prototype MUST include (6 modules max)
Please implement these 6 modules only (keep it clean and non-confusing):

Module A - Portfolio Overview (Executive Snapshot)
Goal: 10-second view of portfolio ESG position.
Show max 6 KPIs:

Portfolio Value (₦) + #Projects
Total financed amount and number of facilities/projects tracked.

ESG Data Completeness %
% of required ESG fields submitted and validated.

PFI Reporting Timeliness (On-time vs Late)
Which PFIs complied with reporting deadlines.

Green Taxonomy Classified % (by portfolio value)
% of portfolio classified Green/Transition/Not Green.

Carbon Summary (Scope 1 / 2 / 3 totals)
tCO₂e totals - sample values acceptable for PoC.

Top ESG Flags (RAG)
Count of red/amber/green flags based on missing data, failed validations, missing evidence, and high-risk sectors.

Module B - Portfolio Drilldown (Projects/Facilities Register)
Goal: DBN can drill into PFIs/projects.
Minimum fields per project:

Project ID, PFI name, sector, location (state), amount, dates

Taxonomy status: Green / Transition / Not Green

ESG status: Complete / Incomplete + RAG

Carbon status: Scope 1/2/3 present? (Y/N)

Module C - PFI Submissions (Excel Import + Validation + Approval) (core of “integrated”)
You already have Forms Management + Import Data - repurpose it into PFI submissions.

Required features:

Upload/Import Excel (PFI ESG template)

System runs validations → generates Error Log table

Status workflow: Draft → Submitted → Validated → Approved → Published

Include a Data Quality Score per PFI (e.g., 92%, 76%) driven by validation results

Error Log table columns (minimum):

Field | Issue | Row/Record ID | Severity | Status | Action

Module D - Green Taxonomy Classification
Goal: Show the DBN taxonomy digitised in the system.
Must include:

Simple “taxonomy rules” table (Category, Criteria/threshold, evidence required)

Classification output per project: Green / Transition / Not Green

Evidence status: Provided / Missing (file upload placeholder is fine)

Module E - Carbon & Net Zero
Goal: Show that carbon accounting and target tracking exist.
Must include:

Portfolio and project-level Scope 1 / 2 / 3 totals

Simple calculation logic: Activity Data × Emission Factor = tCO₂e (PoC-level)

Targets: baseline year, target year, target %, progress bar

Module F - Reports / Export
Keep it minimal:

Button 1: Export DBN ESG Portfolio Pack (PDF)

Button 2: Export PFI Compliance Summary (Excel)

Optional Button 3: Export Carbon & Net Zero Summary (PDF)

5) What to REMOVE / De-prioritize for this PoC
To keep it fast and focused:

Remove “Event Reports” (speakers/attendees etc.) - not relevant

Remove beneficiary satisfaction surveys unless you can directly repurpose into “PFI ESG submissions”

Avoid adding too many SDG pages - SDG should be one widget layer, not the whole product

6) Dataset requirement (so the PoC feels real)
Please use one consistent sample dataset across modules (same project IDs).
Minimum dataset fields:

Project ID, PFI, Sector, State, Amount, Start/End dates

SDG tags (top 5)

ESG completeness %, timeliness status

Taxonomy classification + evidence status

Scope 1/2/3 emissions + baseline + target + current

7) Naming updates (DBN language)
Please rename menus so DBN users relate instantly:

Programmes → Projects / Facilities

Goals & Indicators → ESG Metrics & Standards

Forms Management → PFI Submissions

Insights → ESG Analytics

Reports → Reports (keep)

8) PoC success criteria (what “done” looks like)
The PoC is complete when we can show, in one continuous walkthrough:
Overview → project drilldown → PFI Excel upload → validation errors → approve/publish → taxonomy status → carbon view → export report.

Thank you
