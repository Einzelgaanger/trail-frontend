2. Executive Summary
Trail is a next-generation Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) web application designed to
empower organizations with end-to-end visibility, control, and insight into their data management
and performance tracking lifecycle. Built specifically for development agencies, government
institutions, donor-funded programs, and NGOs, Trail offers a robust digital infrastructure for
planning, collecting, analyzing, and visualizing project and program performance in real-time.
At its core, Trail addresses the critical pain points that plague traditional M&E systems:
fragmented data silos, manual reporting processes, poor indicator alignment, and lack of timely
decision-making insights. Through an intuitive interface and flexible modular design, Trail
centralizes all aspects of M&E—starting from program and KPI definition, through structured
data collection (both online and offline), to dynamic dashboards and AI-assisted analytics.
With the growing demand for results-based management, real-time reporting, and transparent
accountability in development work, Trail is strategically positioned to support organizations in
measuring what truly matters. It enables teams to define custom logframes, map indicators to
SDGs or national strategies, track progress across multiple administrative tiers (from LGA to
national level), and generate reports that meet donor and internal requirements.
Trail’s value lies not just in its technology, but in its alignment with real-world M&E
contexts—especially in Africa. It is built with offline capabilities for field data collectors,
multilingual options for localization, role-based access for multi-stakeholder collaboration, and
extensibility for integration with platforms like DHIS2, ODK, KoboToolbox, and government
systems.
As Trail evolves, its long-term aspiration is to become Africa’s leading M&E technology
ecosystem—powering evidence-based decision-making, enhancing program transparency, and
transforming how data drives impact at scale.
Key Highlights of Trail:
● Trail is broken down into 5 key Modules
○ BENEFIT REGISTER - This Module maintains a centralized “social impact
ledger” of all benefits a household has received. Ensuring no duplications and
enabling longitudinal tracking of household progress.
○ TETRA - This Module helps to Identify who needs help and determines what
type of help they should receive. Uses customizable poverty indicators,
biometrics or documents for ID, and integrates with existing national, state or
third-party registries as needed.
○ TELLAR - Aggregates data from TETRA,TRACE, BENEFITS REGISTER, and
TALKIT into actionable dashboards and reports. Supports real‐time analytics,
impact modeling, and anomaly detection, guiding adaptive program
management.
○ TRACE - This Module is the operational core that moves resources (cash,
goods, services) from funders to beneficiaries. Provides conditional workflows,
multi‐level approvals, payment integrations, and robust audit trails.
○ TALKIT - This Module offers a mobile‐friendly, offline‐capable platform for data
collection and beneficiary feedback. Integrates call centers, USSD, and chatbots
for real‐time issue resolution and feedback loops.
○ SecureAccess – SSO & Identity Management - Provides a unified login across
all DANFO modules, complete with multi‐factor authentication, robust role‐based
access controls, and fully auditable user management.
● Full M&E lifecycle support: From program setup to data visualization
● Offline mobile data collection for remote areas
● Customizable dashboards and reporting frameworks
● Integration-ready with external tools (DHIS2, Kobo, etc.)
● AI-assisted data analysis for faster insights
● Scalable architecture to support local, regional, and national M&E systems
3. Problem Statement
Despite the increasing importance of Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) in development
programs, most M&E professionals continue to face significant operational, technical, and
strategic challenges that hinder their ability to generate actionable insights and ensure
accountability. These challenges cut across data collection, analysis, reporting, and
decision-making, ultimately impacting program performance and transparency.
Key Challenges Faced by M&E Professionals::
1. Fragmented Data Ecosystems
M&E professionals often deal with disjointed tools for data collection, storage, analysis, and
reporting. Information is scattered across spreadsheets, paper forms, and unconnected
software systems, leading to data loss, duplication, and inconsistencies.
2. Manual and Time-Consuming Reporting
Due to a lack of automation, significant time is spent aggregating data, verifying its accuracy,
and generating reports manually. This delays decision-making and limits the ability to respond to
emerging issues in real time.
3. Limited Visibility Across Programs and Locations
Programs spread across multiple regions or LGAs suffer from a lack of centralized tracking.
Field data is often delayed, incomplete, or inaccurate, making it difficult to measure performance
holistically or benchmark progress at the organizational level.
4. Offline Data Collection Limitations
In low-connectivity or rural environments, field staff cannot reliably collect and submit data in
real-time. Many tools lack offline capability, leading to reliance on paper forms that introduce
errors and delays in data digitization.
5. Weak Indicator Alignment and Performance Tracking
M&E professionals struggle to define and align indicators to organizational goals, donor
frameworks, SDGs, or logical frameworks. Monitoring is rarely linked to clear baselines and
targets, resulting in superficial or inconsistent evaluation.
6. Inadequate Dashboards and Data Visualization Tools
Many M&E systems lack powerful dashboards and analytics to visualize trends or generate
insights. Professionals are unable to present data in a way that is compelling, accessible, or
useful for decision-makers.
7. Data Quality and Integrity Issues
Poor data validation, lack of audit trails, and inadequate access control result in compromised
data quality. This undermines trust in reported results and makes it difficult to defend program
impact to funders and stakeholders.
8. Lack of Customization and Scalability
Off-the-shelf tools often do not reflect the specific context of African institutions or evolving
program needs. They lack scalability, localization support, or integration with government and
donor platforms—limiting their long-term utility.
9. Insufficient Collaboration Across Stakeholders
M&E processes require input from multiple roles (field agents, program managers, donors, etc.).
Without collaborative workflows and role-based access, it becomes difficult to coordinate across
teams, validate findings, or consolidate insights.
10. Difficulty Demonstrating Impact
Ultimately, the biggest challenge M&E professionals face is proving that programs are delivering
measurable, meaningful impact. Without a system that connects field-level evidence to strategic
objectives, it becomes difficult to justify funding or shape future program design.
